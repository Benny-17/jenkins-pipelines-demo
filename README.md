# Jenkins Demo

  A simple declarative Jenkins pipeline to run basic shell steps.

- `multi-stage-docker/`  
  A more advanced pipeline using Docker containers as agents for each stage.

## Technologies Used

- Jenkins
- Docker
- Groovy (Jenkins Pipeline)
- GitHub for SCM integration

## Goal

To learn and demonstrate:
- Declarative pipelines
- Jenkins + Docker agent usage
- Stage-specific builds
- SCM integration using GitHub

## Setup (for both demos)

- Jenkins installed on an EC2 instance
- Docker installed and configured for Jenkins user
